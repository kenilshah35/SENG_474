Code.zip contains 2 python jupyer notebooks
One for Decision tree and random forests
Second for Neural networks

Open the jupyter notebooks and Run all cells.
Please keep in mind to have the data file in the same directory as the notebooks

After running all cells the notebooks will output relevant plots and accompanying experiment data

Additionally 2 results pdf files. They contain the experiment run I conducted with the outputs I got alongside the plots
