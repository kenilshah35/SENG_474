Code.zip contains 1 python jupyer notebooks
The code of K-fold cross validation is in that notebok

Open the jupyter notebooks and Run all cells.
Please keep in mind to have the data file and mnist_reader.py file in the same directory as the notebooks

After running all cells the notebooks will output relevant plots and accompanying experiment data

Additionally 1 results pdf files. They contain the experiment run I conducted with the outputs I got alongside the plots.
All the plots are in the figures folder
